# Real-Time Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a low-cost, real-time Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system for fluid dynamics research. PIV is a widely used technique to measure velocity fields by tracking particles suspended in a fluid. Traditional PIV systems often use expensive laser-based setups, which can be prohibitive for small-scale research labs or educational institutions. Our approach leverages digital cameras and LED illumination to achieve comparable results at a fraction of the cost.

## Key Features

- **Cost-Effective Design**: By replacing lasers with digital cameras and LEDs, we significantly reduce the equipment costs associated with PIV systems while maintaining accuracy.
  
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Implemented image processing algorithms enable the system to compute velocity fields in real-time, providing immediate feedback for experimental setups.
  
- **High Resolution**: Utilizing high-resolution digital cameras ensures detailed particle tracking and accurate velocity measurements.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the need for accessible and affordable fluid dynamics measurement tools. By democratizing access to PIV technology through a low-cost alternative, we aim to empower smaller research teams and educational institutions to conduct advanced fluid dynamics studies.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the PIV system, follow the instructions in the `Installation.md` file. It includes hardware requirements, software dependencies, and step-by-step setup procedures.

## Usage

1. **Hardware Setup**: Position the digital cameras and LED illumination according to the experimental setup requirements.
  
2. **Software Initialization**: Launch the PIV software and configure the camera parameters (resolution, exposure, frame rate).

3. **Data Acquisition**: Start capturing images of the particle-laden fluid flow using the PIV system.

4. **Real-Time Analysis**: Use the software's real-time analysis capabilities to compute and visualize velocity fields.
